<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Acting Insulins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lispro</li><li>Aspart (NovoLog)</li><li>Glulisine (Apidra)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapid acting insulins are a crucial component in managing blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes. Three main types of rapid acting insulins are Lispro, Aspart (NovoLog), and Glulisine (Apidra). These insulins work quickly to lower blood sugar levels after meals, making them ideal for controlling postprandial glucose spikes. Lispro, Aspart, and Glulisine are all designed to mimic the body's natural insulin response, but each may have slight differences in onset and duration of action. These insulins are widely used in the market for their effectiveness and quick action.</p></p>
