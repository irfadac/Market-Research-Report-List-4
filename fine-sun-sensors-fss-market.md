<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fine Sun Sensors FSS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Size (Less than 5g)</li><li>Other Size (Above 5g)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fine Sun Sensors (FSS) come in two main market types based on their size. Small size sensors, weighing less than 5g, are often used in smaller satellites and CubeSats where every gram of weight matters. On the other hand, other sized FSS above 5g are commonly used in larger satellites and spacecraft where weight constraints are not as critical. Both types of FSS serve the same purpose of providing precise attitude determination by measuring the sun's position relative to the spacecraft.</p></p>
