<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propane Refrigeration Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston Compressor</li><li>Screw Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propane refrigeration compressors are commonly available in two types: piston compressors and screw compressors. Piston compressors use a reciprocating piston driven by a crankshaft to compress the propane gas, making them suitable for smaller applications. On the other hand, screw compressors use interlocking helical rotors to compress the gas, making them more efficient and suitable for larger-scale applications. Both types of compressors play a crucial role in the propane refrigeration industry, providing reliable and efficient cooling solutions.</p></p>
