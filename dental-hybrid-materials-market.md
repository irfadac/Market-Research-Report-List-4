<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Hybrid Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opaque</li><li>Translucent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental hybrid materials are available in two main types: opaque and translucent. Opaque materials are used in situations where maximum coverage or opacity is needed, such as for restoring severely damaged teeth or for masking metal posts in a restoration. On the other hand, translucent materials are used when a more natural look is desired, allowing light to pass through the material for a more lifelike appearance. Dentists can choose between these two types based on the specific needs of each individual patient.</p></p>
