<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constant Velocity Universal Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ball</li><li>Fork</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The constant velocity universal joint market is commonly divided into two main types: ball and fork. Ball-type universal joints utilize a spherical ball that allows for a wide range of motion and smooth rotation, making them ideal for applications requiring flexibility. Fork-type universal joints, on the other hand, utilize a forked yoke design to transmit power between shafts at a constant velocity. Both types have their own advantages and are commonly used in various industries for different applications.</p></p>
