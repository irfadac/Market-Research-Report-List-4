<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber</li><li>Dual Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Market Types include Single Chamber and Dual Chamber devices. Single Chamber ICDs have one lead in the heart, while Dual Chamber ICDs have two leads for pacing and sensing in both the atrium and the ventricle. Single Chamber devices are simpler, more cost-effective, and have a lower risk of complications. Dual Chamber devices offer more advanced features such as synchronized pacing, improved heart rate control, and reduced risk of inappropriate shocks. Both types play a crucial role in treating life-threatening arrhythmias.</p></p>
