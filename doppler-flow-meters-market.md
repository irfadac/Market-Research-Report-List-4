<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler Flow Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-sensor Doppler Flow Meters</li><li>Two-sensor Doppler Flow Meters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Doppler flow meters are used to measure the flow rate of liquids by detecting the frequency shift caused by particles in motion. One-sensor Doppler flow meters use a single transducer to emit and receive ultrasonic waves, while two-sensor Doppler flow meters use two transducers to measure flow from two different angles. One-sensor meters are simpler and more cost-effective, while two-sensor meters offer improved accuracy and can compensate for factors like temperature and viscosity. Both types are widely used in industries such as wastewater management, chemical processing, and food and beverage production.</p></p>
