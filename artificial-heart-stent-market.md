<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial heart stent market consists of three main types: Bare-metal Stent (BMS), Drug-eluting Stent (DES), and Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS). Bare-metal stents are metal mesh tubes used to keep arteries open after procedures, while drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent blockages. Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds are temporary stents that dissolve over time, allowing natural vessel function to return. Each type offers unique benefits for patients with coronary artery disease and other heart conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acute Myocardial Infarction</li><li>Unstable Angina</li><li>Angina Pectoris</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial heart stents are used in the treatment of various cardiovascular conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and angina pectoris. They are inserted into blocked or narrowed arteries to improve blood flow to the heart. Acute myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked. Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs even at rest, and angina pectoris is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Artificial heart stents help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of complications in these conditions.</p></p>
