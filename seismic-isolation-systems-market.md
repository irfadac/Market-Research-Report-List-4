<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Isolation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NRB</li><li>LRB</li><li>HDR</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seismic isolation systems are designed to protect buildings and structures from the damaging effects of earthquakes. The four main types of seismic isolation systems are NRB (neoprene rubber bearing), LRB (lead rubber bearing), HDR (high damping rubber), and Others. NRB systems use rubber bearings to absorb seismic energy, while LRB systems incorporate lead cores for added damping. HDR systems use high damping rubber to provide greater energy dissipation. Other types of seismic isolation systems may include hybrid systems or innovative technologies that offer unique approaches to protecting structures during seismic events.</p></p>
