<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buffer and Line Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three States</li><li>Open Drain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Buffer and Line Driver markets are classified into three states: off, high impedance, and on. In the off state, the output is disconnected from the input. The high impedance state allows multiple outputs to be connected together without interference. The on state actively drives the output to a defined logic level. In the Open Drain market, outputs are either pulled low (0) or left floating. This type of market is commonly used in systems where multiple devices share a common communication line.</p></p>
