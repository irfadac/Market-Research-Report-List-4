<p><p>Non-covered metal biliary stents are used to treat biliary strictures or blockages in the bile duct. They can be either absorbable or non-absorbable. Absorbable stents gradually break down and are absorbed by the body over time. Non-absorbable stents remain in place permanently. Both types of stents provide structural support to keep the bile duct open and allow for proper drainage. The choice between absorbable and non-absorbable stents depends on the individual patient's condition and the recommendation of their healthcare provider.</p></p>
