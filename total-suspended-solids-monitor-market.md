<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Total Suspended Solids Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Probe</li><li>Insert Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Total Suspended Solids (TSS) monitors are available in two main types: submersible probes and insert probes. Submersible probes are designed to be fully submerged in the water and provide continuous real-time monitoring of TSS levels. They are ideal for applications where the water body is deep or where direct access is difficult. On the other hand, insert probes are designed to be easily inserted into a pipe or channel for monitoring TSS levels. They are convenient for applications where spot monitoring is sufficient.</p></p>
