<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Headsets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNR headsets</li><li>ANR headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aviation headset market primarily features two types: Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) and Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets utilize physical barriers, like ear cups, to block ambient noise, offering decent sound isolation at a lower cost. In contrast, ANR headsets employ advanced technology to actively cancel out unwanted sounds, providing superior noise reduction, better audio quality, and increased comfort for pilots during prolonged use. The choice between PNR and ANR largely depends on specific flying conditions and individual preferences.</p></p>
