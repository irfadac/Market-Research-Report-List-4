<p><strong>The Water Softeners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Salt Based Water Softeners</li><li>Salt Free Water Softeners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water softeners are devices used to remove minerals that cause hard water, such as calcium and magnesium. There are two main types of water softeners: salt-based and salt-free. </p><p>Salt-based water softeners use a process called ion exchange to replace calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions. Salt-free water softeners, on the other hand, use a different method such as template-assisted crystallization or electromagnetic waves to neutralize the minerals without adding salt to the water. Both types are effective in reducing the negative effects of hard water.</p></p>
