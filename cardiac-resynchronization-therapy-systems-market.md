<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemaker</li><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Systems are medical devices used to treat heart failure by improving the coordination of the heart's contractions. There are two main types of CRT systems: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-P) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-D). CRT-P devices deliver electrical impulses to both ventricles to help them beat in sync, while CRT-D devices can also deliver shocks to treat dangerous arrhythmias. Both types of devices have been proven to improve symptoms and outcomes in heart failure patients.</p></p>
