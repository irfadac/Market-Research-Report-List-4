<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerated Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cycling</li><li>Non-cycling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigerated air dryers come in two main types: cycling and non-cycling. Cycling dryers turn on and off based on the demand for compressed air, which helps save energy but may lead to fluctuations in dew point levels. Non-cycling dryers operate continuously regardless of air demand, providing a consistent dew point but consuming more energy. The choice between cycling and non-cycling dryers depends on factors such as energy efficiency goals, air demand variability, and required dew point levels.</p></p>
